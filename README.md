I cant lie creative computing :)
i dont really understand you!!
I dreaded this brief and funny enough it was to be my first one so here we go 
My first thoughts on the brief, i was really confused on what we were expected off, sometimes broad is good, buit when its something to do with coding, computing thats when my brain will go pause 
writing a read me file to begin with
its actually quite simple to understand the reason behind the file and what it is use for but actually creating the read me file itself was a pain to understand
BUT I GOT THERE IN THE END 
The subject creatvie computing was more than i thought after doing some research

     yeah sorry I have no idea what this is anyways 
    
LEARNING ARDUINO 
In class we were given a starter kit which consists of 
•	LED
•	Switches
•	Resistor
•	An Arduino uno
•	Bred board
•	Jumper wires
We were then asked to wire up and LED with the guidance from a YouTube video. 
The beginner’s video was very straightforward and the instructions given was clear and I was able to understand what I needed to do to light up the LED. 
Some technical terms which were mentioned throughout the video
Current - Current is the amount of electrical charge passing through the circuit per second.

Voltage - For Arduino Uno, voltages can be read in the range of 0-5V. These 0-5V values are divided into 1023 equal parts. 
The AD converter converts the analogy voltage reading to the nearest equal value.

Resistance - resistors resist the flow of electricity and the higher the value of the resistor, 
the more it resists and the less electrical current will flow through it. 
Yep I have no idea what that means
But i would like to cop one of those starter kits, it was fun to play around with

THE CREATIVE COMPUTING COMMUNITIES
These communities gathered/ created online allows them to have a public platform which allows a 
universal group to become one together through the world of computing and coding. 
P5 Js is a community that acknowledges and praises diversity 
“they believe that new comers are just as valuable in this effort as experts”
•	They want to make coding accessible for everyone
•	They encourage movement but also recognises that everyone does not have the financial status of capacity to actively participate 
They provide what anyone can contribute for their community 
o	Development 
o	Document 
o	Teach 
o	Create 
o	Donation 
This community is really interesting and very welcoming they allow new comers to feel at ease, the information they provide is straightforward and easy to access. 

Another community i researched 
Stack overflow is a public platform accessible to those who need answers and guidance on the coding, computing and technical subject. 
It is a community-based space to find and contribute answers to technical challenges. They allow others to share their knowledge and gain and learn from others. 
Their website also allows people to earn reputation points/ badges which encourages and boosts engagement to also value one’s contribution to the community. 
This is known as gamification 
A strategic attempt to enhance systems services, systems, organizations and activities in order to create similar experiences to those who play games in order to motivate and engage the users within the community.  

This creative computing community is based on using each other for help and guidance, they are welcoming for those who may be new to this world like myself. I feel like if I need support on technical terms, and help with coding, I can come to this website and would find my answers and guidance. 

I am still very much confused on what this brief required as an outcome but I was able to have a brief introduction into the world of creative computing and coding. Understanding that coding is within our daily lives but is overlooked by many even myself, like automatic doors, escalators, anything we use daily, there is always some sort of coding behind it. 
This has enabled me to stay curious about things around me, being more intrigued about the science behind things that make up our living or make our daily lives easier. Realising that communities within this subject are not all advanced as we think, there are people who offer endless support, information and guidance to those who are known as a beginner. In the near future, I will like to learn more in depth on the use of coding and the physical computing. To also be able to use the knowledge I learn and think of ways of how it can elevate the work I produce in the future. <3
